# WeatherDashboard
Weather information for multiple cities! 

## Motivation 
* Weather tracking at the tip of your fingers in order to make travel planning easier. 


## Problems 
* Unable to create travel plans without a weather forecast for current weather and 5 day forecast. 


## Solution 
* Use an API to help create a new application that assists in weather display of 6 days. 



## User Story 
* As a  traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
So that I can plan a trip accordingly.


## Issues and Learned Experiences 
* fetching API with longitude and latitude adjustments
* dynamically creating elements aligned with data 
* Appening my weather cards, I had them showing and now they are not. 
* Working with API because the API Key has constantly closed out. 
 * Appending the cards and moving forward with storage creation. 404 reject tried to resolve but not able to. Not sure what is going on with API. 

### Credits 
* Special thanks to the API weather dashboard, provided super quick keys for accessing the API.
